# Exercise 13
## Valgrind revisited



1) In the `ex13` directory, `list_errors.c` contains functions that make and modify linked lists.
It doesn't free anything, so it leaks memory.  Compile and run it, then run it using Valgrind and/or
Valkyrie:

```
    make list_errors
    valgrind --leak-check=yes ./list_errors

      ==62827== LEAK SUMMARY:
      ==62827==    definitely lost: 48 bytes in 3 blocks
      ==62827==    indirectly lost: 112 bytes in 7 blocks
      ==62827==      possibly lost: 72 bytes in 3 blocks

      ==62827== ERROR SUMMARY: 4 errors from 4 contexts (suppressed: 11 from 11)
    
```
After change: 
```

```
This is perhaps a macos error..

```
Modify the program so that before it exits it frees everything it allocated.  Use Valgrind to check.

2) Also in this directory, `word_count.c` contains a solution to Exercise 8 that leaks memory.
Compile and run it with Valgrind and/or Valkyrie:

```
    make word_count
    valgrind --leak-check=yes ./word_count
    valkyrie ./word_count
```

Then make the program run cleanly with no memory errors and no leaks.

Hints: 

* You might find it helpful to make copies of some data in order to
  avoid sharing allocated chunks between data structures.  Controlling
  the complexity of memory management sometimes comes with a
  performance cost.

* Focus on "definitely lost" and "indirectly lost."  Some of the
  "possibly lost" are due to the inner workings of GLib.  [This
  page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind) has some suggestions for
  dealing with that.

I was able to get my solution down to 

```
    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
    still reachable: 2,116 bytes in 5 blocks
         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
```

The "still reachable" blocks seem to be in the GLib hash table, but I
am not sure.
